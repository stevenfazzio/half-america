A topology optimization experiment visualizing US population distribution with smooth, organic shapes instead of dusty dots or blocky counties.

> Where does half of America *really* live?

## The Problem

Traditional "half of America lives here" maps have two issues:

1. **The San Bernardino Problem**: County boundaries include vast empty areas (San Bernardino County is larger than nine US states but mostly desert)
2. **The Dust Problem**: Using smaller units creates thousands of disconnected specks that fail as visualization

This project solves both using **Max-Flow Min-Cut optimization** with a user-controlled "surface tension" parameter.

## How It Works

A slider controls lambda:

- **lambda ~ 0**: Minimizes area, showing high-resolution "dusty" city centers
- **lambda ~ 1**: Minimizes perimeter, creating smooth, compact blobs

See [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) for the mathematical formulation.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd half_america
uv sync
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the CLI
uv run half-america

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Format code
uv run black src/ tests/

# Lint
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# Type check
uv run mypy src/
```

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Initial skeleton (Phase 0)
